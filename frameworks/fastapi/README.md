# FastAPI Framework Package

## Purpose

Build secure, typed, asynchronous FastAPI services with explicit models, dependencies, authorization, lifecycle, errors, and tests.

This package is a project-agnostic framework overlay. It specializes the [Python language package](../../languages/python/) and relevant discipline standards for FastAPI projects.

Status: **baseline**

A baseline package is usable for adoption and review but should continue to mature through real project feedback, compatibility review, and specialist scrutiny.

## When to adopt this package

Adopt this package when:

- FastAPI routes, dependencies, request or response models, middleware, or exception handlers change
- authentication, authorization, OpenAPI behavior, background tasks, or lifespan behavior changes
- async and sync I/O boundaries, database sessions, queues, or external clients change
- deployment workers, startup, shutdown, testing, or compatibility behavior changes

Do not omit it merely because the framework appears familiar. Familiarity is not a substitute for declaring how the project uses configuration, security, lifecycle, tests, and operational behavior.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- the Python language package
- application security, API engineering, testing, privacy, observability, database, or SRE disciplines
- the ASGI server, deployment platform, or data-access library's own standards

It also does not select framework extensions, libraries, hosting models, cloud services, or organizational controls for an adopting project.

## Normative entry point

Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). It preserves the framework's mandatory rule identifiers, defines instruction precedence, and points to the supporting standards.

[`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md) defines required files and package acceptance checks.

## Supporting standards

| Standard | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`Application Structure Standard`](standards/APPLICATION_STRUCTURE_STANDARD.md) | Define routers, dependencies, services, data access, configuration, lifecycle, and package boundaries without concentrating the application in one module. |
| [`Models and Validation Standard`](standards/MODELS_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md) | Use explicit request and response models, strict validation, bounded inputs, safe serialization, and stable OpenAPI contracts. |
| [`Authorization and Security Standard`](standards/AUTHORIZATION_SECURITY_STANDARD.md) | Implement authentication and object-level authorization server-side, protect secrets, configure CORS deliberately, and test denied access. |
| [`Async and Concurrency Standard`](standards/ASYNC_CONCURRENCY_STANDARD.md) | Keep blocking I/O out of async paths, define cancellation, timeouts, pools, background work, thread usage, and process-worker assumptions. |
| [`Errors and Dependencies Standard`](standards/ERRORS_DEPENDENCIES_STANDARD.md) | Use consistent safe errors, dependency injection, cleanup, transaction scoping, and explicit failure behavior. |
| [`Observability and Lifespan Standard`](standards/OBSERVABILITY_LIFESPAN_STANDARD.md) | Define startup, shutdown, readiness, health, logs, metrics, traces, correlation, and resource cleanup. |
| [`Testing Standard`](standards/TESTING_STANDARD.md) | Test models, validation, dependencies, authorization, OpenAPI, async behavior, errors, lifecycle, data access, and integration boundaries. |
| [`FastAPI Completion Evidence`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md) | Record models, authorization, async boundaries, errors, dependency cleanup, lifecycle, tests, OpenAPI compatibility, and limitations. |

## Adoption workflow

1. Read the root governance standards.
2. Select the project profile.
3. Adopt the [Python language package](../../languages/python/).
4. Confirm this framework package applies.
5. Select relevant disciplines, platforms, virtualization systems, operating systems, and networking systems.
6. Copy or compose the complete package.
7. Preserve stable identifiers.
8. Declare exact supported framework, language, runtime, build, and deployment constraints.
9. Complete the adoption checklist.
10. Define project-specific validation commands.
11. Review compatibility and migration implications.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Project tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- exact supported framework and language versions
- application architecture and framework extension points
- configuration sources and precedence
- secrets and identity integration
- request, rendering, routing, or message boundaries
- dependency injection, state, session, or provider ownership
- data access and transaction behavior
- async, concurrency, cancellation, and background-work behavior
- error contracts and diagnostic boundaries
- health, telemetry, and operational ownership
- build, packaging, deployment, and migration constraints
- test layers and representative environments
- compatibility commitments
- evidence location and reviewers

## Security expectations

- Treat all external input and client state as untrusted.
- Enforce authorization at the protected server-side operation.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles, committed settings, logs, errors, and examples.
- Review framework bypass APIs and unsafe escape hatches.
- Bound input sizes, timeouts, retries, resource use, and diagnostic exposure.
- Use approved cryptography and identity integrations.
- Test denied, invalid, boundary, timeout, and failure behavior.
- Do not infer security from framework popularity. Popular software can still be configured by humans.

## Lifecycle and concurrency expectations

The project must define:

- startup and initialization behavior
- readiness and dependency checks
- request or render cancellation
- background and asynchronous work ownership
- connection, session, subscription, or resource cleanup
- graceful shutdown
- retry and idempotency behavior
- worker, process, thread, event-loop, or browser assumptions
- failure and recovery behavior

## Testing expectations

Framework tests should cover:

- configuration validation
- application startup
- public contracts and user-visible behavior
- negative authorization and invalid input
- lifecycle and cleanup
- integration with representative dependencies
- framework middleware, routing, rendering, or dependency behavior
- errors and failure paths
- compatibility and migration-sensitive behavior
- accessibility where a user interface exists
- build and packaging behavior

Do not replace meaningful tests with a successful application startup and a hopeful expression.

## Suggested validation

Use repository-defined commands. Typical checks include:

- the repository's pinned environment installation
- formatting, lint, and type checks
- `python -m pytest` or repository-defined tests
- OpenAPI contract review
- authorization and validation tests
- async and lifecycle integration tests

Record commands exactly and distinguish passed, failed, and not-run checks.

## Completion evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- changed files
- framework and language versions
- affected boundaries and contracts
- security and configuration effects
- lifecycle and concurrency effects
- exact validation commands and results
- representative environment details
- compatibility and migration impact
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risks
- reviewer identity or role

## Common failure modes

- using sync I/O inside async routes
- treating dependency injection as authorization by itself
- returning internal exception text
- omitting response models
- running durable work as in-process background tasks
- forgetting session and client cleanup

Other recurring failures include copying example configuration into production, assuming defaults remain unchanged across versions, ignoring project-specific deployment behavior, and reporting completion without evidence.

## Companion packages

This framework commonly composes with:

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [API Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Database Engineering](../../disciplines/database/)
- [Python](../../languages/python/)

Companion packages supplement this framework overlay. They do not replace its applicable rules.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Templates are starting points. Replace fictitious values with reviewed project facts and never insert production secrets.

## Maintaining the package

Changes must:

- preserve stable identifiers unless a breaking change is approved
- update README, manifest, standards, templates, and examples together
- state supported-version and migration impact
- keep requirements specific and testable
- validate links and identifiers
- disclose checks not run
- avoid unsupported claims about framework defaults

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that a FastAPI application is secure, accessible, reliable, compatible, tested, or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, evidence, and accountable review.
