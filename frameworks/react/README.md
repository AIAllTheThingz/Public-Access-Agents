# React Framework Package

## Purpose

Build accessible, secure, maintainable React interfaces with explicit state, data flow, rendering, and testing boundaries.

This package is a project-agnostic framework overlay. It specializes the [JavaScript and TypeScript language package](../../languages/javascript-typescript/) and relevant discipline standards for React projects.

Status: **baseline**

A baseline package is usable for adoption and review but should continue to mature through real project feedback, compatibility review, and specialist scrutiny.

## When to adopt this package

Adopt this package when:

- React components, hooks, context, routing, forms, or client-side state change
- the application fetches or mutates remote data
- rendering behavior, accessibility, performance, hydration, or error boundaries change
- the project uses React directly or through a framework that preserves React component semantics

Do not omit it merely because the framework appears familiar. Familiarity is not a substitute for declaring how the project uses configuration, security, lifecycle, tests, and operational behavior.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- the JavaScript and TypeScript language package
- accessibility, application security, testing, privacy, API engineering, or observability disciplines
- framework-specific guidance for a React meta-framework unless explicitly added

It also does not select framework extensions, libraries, hosting models, cloud services, or organizational controls for an adopting project.

## Normative entry point

Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). It preserves the framework's mandatory rule identifiers, defines instruction precedence, and points to the supporting standards.

[`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md) defines required files and package acceptance checks.

## Supporting standards

| Standard | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`Component Architecture Standard`](standards/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md) | Define component responsibilities, composition boundaries, ownership, reuse, and public props without turning every file into an abstraction ceremony. |
| [`State and Data Flow Standard`](standards/STATE_DATA_FLOW_STANDARD.md) | Keep state minimal, colocated, and authoritative; avoid duplicated derived state and document cache, synchronization, and invalidation behavior. |
| [`Accessibility Standard`](standards/ACCESSIBILITY_STANDARD.md) | Use semantic HTML, keyboard support, visible focus, labels, announcements, error association, reduced motion, and accessible loading behavior. |
| [`Security Standard`](standards/SECURITY_STANDARD.md) | Treat browser state as untrusted, avoid unsafe HTML injection, do not expose secrets, and enforce authorization on the server. |
| [`Routing and Data Fetching Standard`](standards/ROUTING_DATA_FETCHING_STANDARD.md) | Define route ownership, loading, error, cancellation, retries, stale data, optimistic updates, and navigation behavior. |
| [`Performance Standard`](standards/PERFORMANCE_STANDARD.md) | Measure rendering and network behavior before optimization; control bundle size, expensive work, list rendering, and unnecessary re-renders. |
| [`Testing Standard`](standards/TESTING_STANDARD.md) | Test user-visible behavior, accessibility, forms, routing, loading, errors, state transitions, and integration boundaries without coupling tests to implementation details. |
| [`React Completion Evidence`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md) | Record component and state changes, accessibility evidence, security review, rendering and performance observations, tests, compatibility, and limitations. |

## Adoption workflow

1. Read the root governance standards.
2. Select the project profile.
3. Adopt the [JavaScript and TypeScript language package](../../languages/javascript-typescript/).
4. Confirm this framework package applies.
5. Select relevant disciplines and platforms.
6. Copy or compose the complete package.
7. Preserve stable identifiers.
8. Declare exact supported framework, language, runtime, build, and deployment constraints.
9. Complete the adoption checklist.
10. Define project-specific validation commands.
11. Review compatibility and migration implications.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Project tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- exact supported framework and language versions
- application architecture and framework extension points
- configuration sources and precedence
- secrets and identity integration
- request, rendering, routing, or message boundaries
- dependency injection, state, session, or provider ownership
- data access and transaction behavior
- async, concurrency, cancellation, and background-work behavior
- error contracts and diagnostic boundaries
- health, telemetry, and operational ownership
- build, packaging, deployment, and migration constraints
- test layers and representative environments
- compatibility commitments
- evidence location and reviewers

## Security expectations

- Treat all external input and client state as untrusted.
- Enforce authorization at the protected server-side operation.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles, committed settings, logs, errors, and examples.
- Review framework bypass APIs and unsafe escape hatches.
- Bound input sizes, timeouts, retries, resource use, and diagnostic exposure.
- Use approved cryptography and identity integrations.
- Test denied, invalid, boundary, timeout, and failure behavior.
- Do not infer security from framework popularity. Popular software can still be configured by humans.

## Lifecycle and concurrency expectations

The project must define:

- startup and initialization behavior
- readiness and dependency checks
- request or render cancellation
- background and asynchronous work ownership
- connection, session, subscription, or resource cleanup
- graceful shutdown
- retry and idempotency behavior
- worker, process, thread, event-loop, or browser assumptions
- failure and recovery behavior

## Testing expectations

Framework tests should cover:

- configuration validation
- application startup
- public contracts and user-visible behavior
- negative authorization and invalid input
- lifecycle and cleanup
- integration with representative dependencies
- framework middleware, routing, rendering, or dependency behavior
- errors and failure paths
- compatibility and migration-sensitive behavior
- accessibility where a user interface exists
- build and packaging behavior

Do not replace meaningful tests with a successful application startup and a hopeful expression.

## Suggested validation

Use repository-defined commands. Typical checks include:

- the repository's frozen dependency installation
- format and lint checks
- TypeScript type checking when TypeScript is used
- component and integration tests
- production build
- keyboard and accessibility checks for changed user flows

Record commands exactly and distinguish passed, failed, and not-run checks.

## Completion evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- changed files
- framework and language versions
- affected boundaries and contracts
- security and configuration effects
- lifecycle and concurrency effects
- exact validation commands and results
- representative environment details
- compatibility and migration impact
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risks
- reviewer identity or role

## Common failure modes

- duplicating server or derived state
- using divs as buttons
- treating hidden UI as authorization
- adding memoization without evidence
- testing implementation details
- ignoring loading, empty, and error states

Other recurring failures include copying example configuration into production, assuming defaults remain unchanged across versions, ignoring project-specific deployment behavior, and reporting completion without evidence.

## Companion packages

This framework commonly composes with:

- [Accessibility](../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [API Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Privacy and Data Governance](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [JavaScript and TypeScript](../../languages/javascript-typescript/)

Companion packages supplement this framework overlay. They do not replace its applicable rules.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Templates are starting points. Replace fictitious values with reviewed project facts and never insert production secrets.

## Maintaining the package

Changes must:

- preserve stable identifiers unless a breaking change is approved
- update README, manifest, standards, templates, and examples together
- state supported-version and migration impact
- keep requirements specific and testable
- validate links and identifiers
- disclose checks not run
- avoid unsupported claims about framework defaults

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that a React application is secure, accessible, reliable, compatible, tested, or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, evidence, and accountable review.
