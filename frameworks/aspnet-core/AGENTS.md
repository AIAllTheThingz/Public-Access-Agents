# ASP.NET Core Agent Standard

## Purpose

This file defines mandatory rules for agents creating, modifying, reviewing, testing, securing, or documenting ASP.NET Core work.

The framework package supplements the [.NET language package](../../languages/dotnet/) and applicable governance, discipline, platform, profile, and project-specific standards.

> Make the smallest safe, maintainable, testable, observable, and well-documented framework change that satisfies the requirement.

## Scope

This standard applies to framework configuration, architecture, application lifecycle, framework integrations, framework-specific security, tests, build behavior, compatibility, and documentation.

## Instruction precedence

1. Explicit user requirements
2. The nearest more-specific `AGENTS.md`
3. This framework `AGENTS.md`
4. Referenced language, discipline, platform, profile, and governance standards
5. Repository conventions
6. General agent preferences

Report material conflicts instead of silently choosing the convenient interpretation.

## Required supporting standards

Read every applicable supporting standard before implementation:

- `standards/APPLICATION_MODEL_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/SECURITY_AUTHORIZATION_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/HTTP_MIDDLEWARE_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_LIFETIMES_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/DATA_BACKGROUND_WORK_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/OBSERVABILITY_HEALTH_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/TESTING_STANDARD.md`
- `standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`

## Non-negotiable behavior

- Inspect the current application structure, framework configuration, tests, dependencies, and conventions before changing anything.
- Preserve public contracts unless change is explicitly authorized.
- Do not invent runtime versions, endpoints, identities, credentials, data stores, infrastructure, or deployment assumptions.
- Validate external input and trust-boundary data.
- Keep secrets out of source, tests, logs, errors, examples, and committed configuration.
- Do not weaken framework security controls to make a change succeed.
- Use framework extension points deliberately and avoid bypassing built-in safety mechanisms without documented justification.
- Preserve cancellation, cleanup, disposal, teardown, and graceful shutdown behavior.
- Define background and asynchronous work semantics explicitly.
- Add or update tests and documentation with behavior changes.
- State compatibility and migration effects.
- Never claim a test or build passed unless it was run successfully.

## Required working method

1. Discover the current framework, language, runtime, build, deployment, and supported-version constraints.
2. Identify affected framework boundaries and companion disciplines.
3. Classify risk and define acceptance criteria.
4. Review framework defaults and project overrides.
5. Implement the smallest coherent change.
6. Add or update tests, configuration validation, and documentation.
7. Run framework and repository validation.
8. Review the diff for unrelated changes, unsafe defaults, secrets, compatibility regressions, and unresolved placeholders.
9. Record exact evidence, limitations, and checks not run.

## Preserved mandatory rules

### ASPNET-CONFIG-001

**Requirement:** Use strongly typed validated configuration and keep secrets outside configuration files.

**Evidence:** Project-specific review and validation demonstrating the requirement.
### ASPNET-AUTH-002

**Requirement:** Configure authentication and authorization explicitly; protect endpoints by default where appropriate.

**Evidence:** Project-specific review and validation demonstrating the requirement.
### ASPNET-HTTP-003

**Requirement:** Use framework-provided encoding, antiforgery, HTTPS, rate limiting, and error handling features appropriately.

**Evidence:** Project-specific review and validation demonstrating the requirement.
### ASPNET-DI-004

**Requirement:** Use dependency injection with clear lifetimes and avoid service-locator patterns.

**Evidence:** Project-specific review and validation demonstrating the requirement.
### ASPNET-TEST-005

**Requirement:** Use unit and integration tests with representative hosting and middleware behavior.

**Evidence:** Project-specific review and validation demonstrating the requirement.

## Completion evidence

Record:

- framework and language versions
- changed files and affected application boundaries
- configuration and security effects
- lifecycle, concurrency, and cleanup effects
- exact validation commands and outcomes
- compatibility and migration impact
- checks not run
- residual risk and limitations
- accountable review

Do not report framework work complete until applicable evidence is recorded and remaining limitations are explicit.
