# Angular Framework Package

## Purpose

Build structured, accessible, secure Angular applications with clear feature boundaries, reactive behavior, routing, forms, and test coverage.

This package is a project-agnostic framework overlay. It specializes the [JavaScript and TypeScript language package](../../languages/javascript-typescript/) and relevant discipline standards for Angular projects.

Status: **baseline**

A baseline package is usable for adoption and review but should continue to mature through real project feedback, compatibility review, and specialist scrutiny.

## When to adopt this package

Adopt this package when:

- Angular components, directives, pipes, services, guards, resolvers, routes, or forms change
- dependency injection, signals, RxJS streams, change detection, or state management changes
- templates, accessibility, sanitization, internationalization, or lazy loading changes
- the Angular build, test, or deployment model changes

Do not omit it merely because the framework appears familiar. Familiarity is not a substitute for declaring how the project uses configuration, security, lifecycle, tests, and operational behavior.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- the JavaScript and TypeScript language package
- accessibility, application security, testing, API engineering, privacy, or observability disciplines
- project-specific state-management, design-system, or monorepo rules

It also does not select framework extensions, libraries, hosting models, cloud services, or organizational controls for an adopting project.

## Normative entry point

Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). It preserves the framework's mandatory rule identifiers, defines instruction precedence, and points to the supporting standards.

[`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md) defines required files and package acceptance checks.

## Supporting standards

| Standard | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`Application Architecture Standard`](standards/APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md) | Define feature boundaries, shared infrastructure, dependency direction, lazy loading, and ownership without allowing a global dumping-ground module. |
| [`Dependency Injection Standard`](standards/DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_STANDARD.md) | Use providers and injection scopes deliberately, keep services cohesive, avoid hidden global state, and make initialization and teardown explicit. |
| [`Templates and Accessibility Standard`](standards/TEMPLATES_ACCESSIBILITY_STANDARD.md) | Use semantic templates, safe bindings, keyboard support, focus management, labels, errors, announcements, and accessible dynamic content. |
| [`Security Standard`](standards/SECURITY_STANDARD.md) | Rely on Angular sanitization, avoid unsafe bypass APIs, keep secrets out of bundles, validate inputs, and enforce authorization server-side. |
| [`RxJS and Async Standard`](standards/RXJS_ASYNC_STANDARD.md) | Define stream ownership, cancellation, teardown, sharing, errors, retries, and backpressure; prefer clear async behavior over operator puzzles. |
| [`Routing and Forms Standard`](standards/ROUTING_FORMS_STANDARD.md) | Define route access, guards, resolvers, form models, validation, unsaved-change behavior, and deep-link compatibility. |
| [`Testing Standard`](standards/TESTING_STANDARD.md) | Test components, services, routing, forms, async streams, accessibility, errors, and integration behavior using stable user and contract boundaries. |
| [`Angular Completion Evidence`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md) | Record architecture, DI, template, accessibility, RxJS, routing, forms, tests, build, compatibility, and limitations. |

## Adoption workflow

1. Read the root governance standards.
2. Select the project profile.
3. Adopt the [JavaScript and TypeScript language package](../../languages/javascript-typescript/).
4. Confirm this framework package applies.
5. Select relevant disciplines and platforms.
6. Copy or compose the complete package.
7. Preserve stable identifiers.
8. Declare exact supported framework, language, runtime, build, and deployment constraints.
9. Complete the adoption checklist.
10. Define project-specific validation commands.
11. Review compatibility and migration implications.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Project tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- exact supported framework and language versions
- application architecture and framework extension points
- configuration sources and precedence
- secrets and identity integration
- request, rendering, routing, or message boundaries
- dependency injection, state, session, or provider ownership
- data access and transaction behavior
- async, concurrency, cancellation, and background-work behavior
- error contracts and diagnostic boundaries
- health, telemetry, and operational ownership
- build, packaging, deployment, and migration constraints
- test layers and representative environments
- compatibility commitments
- evidence location and reviewers

## Security expectations

- Treat all external input and client state as untrusted.
- Enforce authorization at the protected server-side operation.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles, committed settings, logs, errors, and examples.
- Review framework bypass APIs and unsafe escape hatches.
- Bound input sizes, timeouts, retries, resource use, and diagnostic exposure.
- Use approved cryptography and identity integrations.
- Test denied, invalid, boundary, timeout, and failure behavior.
- Do not infer security from framework popularity. Popular software can still be configured by humans.

## Lifecycle and concurrency expectations

The project must define:

- startup and initialization behavior
- readiness and dependency checks
- request or render cancellation
- background and asynchronous work ownership
- connection, session, subscription, or resource cleanup
- graceful shutdown
- retry and idempotency behavior
- worker, process, thread, event-loop, or browser assumptions
- failure and recovery behavior

## Testing expectations

Framework tests should cover:

- configuration validation
- application startup
- public contracts and user-visible behavior
- negative authorization and invalid input
- lifecycle and cleanup
- integration with representative dependencies
- framework middleware, routing, rendering, or dependency behavior
- errors and failure paths
- compatibility and migration-sensitive behavior
- accessibility where a user interface exists
- build and packaging behavior

Do not replace meaningful tests with a successful application startup and a hopeful expression.

## Suggested validation

Use repository-defined commands. Typical checks include:

- the repository's frozen dependency installation
- Angular build and template compilation
- format, lint, and type checks
- unit and integration tests
- routing and form tests
- keyboard and accessibility checks for changed flows

Record commands exactly and distinguish passed, failed, and not-run checks.

## Completion evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- changed files
- framework and language versions
- affected boundaries and contracts
- security and configuration effects
- lifecycle and concurrency effects
- exact validation commands and results
- representative environment details
- compatibility and migration impact
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risks
- reviewer identity or role

## Common failure modes

- placing unrelated behavior in shared modules or services
- leaking subscriptions
- bypassing sanitization
- assuming route guards provide authorization
- mixing template-driven and reactive form assumptions
- testing private implementation details

Other recurring failures include copying example configuration into production, assuming defaults remain unchanged across versions, ignoring project-specific deployment behavior, and reporting completion without evidence.

## Companion packages

This framework commonly composes with:

- [Accessibility](../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [API Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [JavaScript and TypeScript](../../languages/javascript-typescript/)

Companion packages supplement this framework overlay. They do not replace its applicable rules.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Templates are starting points. Replace fictitious values with reviewed project facts and never insert production secrets.

## Maintaining the package

Changes must:

- preserve stable identifiers unless a breaking change is approved
- update README, manifest, standards, templates, and examples together
- state supported-version and migration impact
- keep requirements specific and testable
- validate links and identifiers
- disclose checks not run
- avoid unsupported claims about framework defaults

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that an Angular application is secure, accessible, reliable, compatible, tested, or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, evidence, and accountable review.
