# Spring Boot Framework Package

## Purpose

Build secure, observable, testable Spring Boot services with explicit configuration, dependency injection, data access, web, and operational behavior.

This package is a project-agnostic framework overlay. It specializes the [Java language package](../../languages/java/) and relevant discipline standards for Spring Boot projects.

Status: **baseline**

A baseline package is usable for adoption and review but should continue to mature through real project feedback, compatibility review, and specialist scrutiny.

## When to adopt this package

Adopt this package when:

- Spring Boot application configuration, beans, auto-configuration, controllers, filters, or services change
- Spring Security, Spring Data, transactions, validation, Actuator, messaging, or scheduled work changes
- profiles, externalized configuration, startup, shutdown, or dependency behavior changes
- the application packaging, runtime, testing, or migration model changes

Do not omit it merely because the framework appears familiar. Familiarity is not a substitute for declaring how the project uses configuration, security, lifecycle, tests, and operational behavior.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- the Java language package
- application security, API engineering, database, testing, observability, privacy, or SRE disciplines
- platform-specific deployment and secret-management standards

It also does not select framework extensions, libraries, hosting models, cloud services, or organizational controls for an adopting project.

## Normative entry point

Start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md). It preserves the framework's mandatory rule identifiers, defines instruction precedence, and points to the supporting standards.

[`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md) defines required files and package acceptance checks.

## Supporting standards

| Standard | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`Application Architecture Standard`](standards/APPLICATION_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md) | Define package boundaries, bean responsibilities, dependency direction, startup behavior, and integration ownership; do not let annotations conceal architecture. |
| [`Configuration and Profiles Standard`](standards/CONFIGURATION_PROFILES_STANDARD.md) | Use typed validated configuration, explicit profile behavior, approved secret stores, and documented precedence without embedding environment assumptions. |
| [`Security Standard`](standards/SECURITY_STANDARD.md) | Configure Spring Security explicitly, protect methods and resources, handle CSRF and CORS appropriately, and test negative authorization paths. |
| [`Data and Transaction Standard`](standards/DATA_TRANSACTION_STANDARD.md) | Use parameterized repositories, explicit transaction boundaries, migration tooling, concurrency controls, and bounded fetch behavior. |
| [`Web and API Standard`](standards/WEB_API_STANDARD.md) | Define validation, errors, serialization, pagination, timeouts, cancellation, idempotency, and compatibility for HTTP and message interfaces. |
| [`Observability and Actuator Standard`](standards/OBSERVABILITY_ACTUATOR_STANDARD.md) | Expose only required health and management endpoints, protect sensitive diagnostics, and define logs, metrics, traces, readiness, and ownership. |
| [`Testing Standard`](standards/TESTING_STANDARD.md) | Use unit, slice, integration, security, migration, contract, startup, and dependency tests proportionate to risk. |
| [`Spring Boot Completion Evidence`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md) | Record configuration, security, data, web, Actuator, tests, build, compatibility, migration, and remaining limitations. |

## Adoption workflow

1. Read the root governance standards.
2. Select the project profile.
3. Adopt the [Java language package](../../languages/java/).
4. Confirm this framework package applies.
5. Select relevant disciplines and platforms.
6. Copy or compose the complete package.
7. Preserve stable identifiers.
8. Declare exact supported framework, language, runtime, build, and deployment constraints.
9. Complete the adoption checklist.
10. Define project-specific validation commands.
11. Review compatibility and migration implications.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Project tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- exact supported framework and language versions
- application architecture and framework extension points
- configuration sources and precedence
- secrets and identity integration
- request, rendering, routing, or message boundaries
- dependency injection, state, session, or provider ownership
- data access and transaction behavior
- async, concurrency, cancellation, and background-work behavior
- error contracts and diagnostic boundaries
- health, telemetry, and operational ownership
- build, packaging, deployment, and migration constraints
- test layers and representative environments
- compatibility commitments
- evidence location and reviewers

## Security expectations

- Treat all external input and client state as untrusted.
- Enforce authorization at the protected server-side operation.
- Keep secrets out of client bundles, committed settings, logs, errors, and examples.
- Review framework bypass APIs and unsafe escape hatches.
- Bound input sizes, timeouts, retries, resource use, and diagnostic exposure.
- Use approved cryptography and identity integrations.
- Test denied, invalid, boundary, timeout, and failure behavior.
- Do not infer security from framework popularity. Popular software can still be configured by humans.

## Lifecycle and concurrency expectations

The project must define:

- startup and initialization behavior
- readiness and dependency checks
- request or render cancellation
- background and asynchronous work ownership
- connection, session, subscription, or resource cleanup
- graceful shutdown
- retry and idempotency behavior
- worker, process, thread, event-loop, or browser assumptions
- failure and recovery behavior

## Testing expectations

Framework tests should cover:

- configuration validation
- application startup
- public contracts and user-visible behavior
- negative authorization and invalid input
- lifecycle and cleanup
- integration with representative dependencies
- framework middleware, routing, rendering, or dependency behavior
- errors and failure paths
- compatibility and migration-sensitive behavior
- accessibility where a user interface exists
- build and packaging behavior

Do not replace meaningful tests with a successful application startup and a hopeful expression.

## Suggested validation

Use repository-defined commands. Typical checks include:

- `./mvnw verify` or `./gradlew check`
- configured formatting and static analysis
- security and authorization tests
- migration and data-access tests
- packaged artifact startup test
- health and management endpoint review

Record commands exactly and distinguish passed, failed, and not-run checks.

## Completion evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- changed files
- framework and language versions
- affected boundaries and contracts
- security and configuration effects
- lifecycle and concurrency effects
- exact validation commands and results
- representative environment details
- compatibility and migration impact
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risks
- reviewer identity or role

## Common failure modes

- using broad component scanning without ownership
- placing secrets in properties files
- assuming default security is sufficient
- creating vague transaction boundaries
- exposing Actuator endpoints publicly
- using full-context tests for everything or nothing

Other recurring failures include copying example configuration into production, assuming defaults remain unchanged across versions, ignoring project-specific deployment behavior, and reporting completion without evidence.

## Companion packages

This framework commonly composes with:

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [API Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Database Engineering](../../disciplines/database/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Java](../../languages/java/)

Companion packages supplement this framework overlay. They do not replace its applicable rules.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Templates are starting points. Replace fictitious values with reviewed project facts and never insert production secrets.

## Maintaining the package

Changes must:

- preserve stable identifiers unless a breaking change is approved
- update README, manifest, standards, templates, and examples together
- state supported-version and migration impact
- keep requirements specific and testable
- validate links and identifiers
- disclose checks not run
- avoid unsupported claims about framework defaults

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that a Spring Boot application is secure, accessible, reliable, compatible, tested, or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, evidence, and accountable review.
