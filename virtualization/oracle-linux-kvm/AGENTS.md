# Oracle Linux KVM Agent Standard

## Purpose

Define mandatory behavior for agents designing, scripting, administering, reviewing, troubleshooting, recovering, or migrating Oracle Linux KVM environments.

This package supplements root governance, the virtualization collection, language packages, engineering disciplines, project profiles, and adopting-project instructions.

## Authoritative boundary

The management authority is the exact Oracle Linux libvirt host for standalone KVM or the authoritative Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager for managed environments.

Do not mutate objects until that authority, environment, stable object scope, and acting identity are verified.

## Scope

- Oracle Linux KVM/QEMU/libvirt hosts
- domains
- storage pools
- virtual networks
- migration
- Oracle VirtIO drivers
- and Oracle Linux Virtualization Manager data centers
- clusters
- hosts
- storage domains
- networks
- VMs

## Required reading

- [Package README](README.md)
- [Package manifest](MANIFEST.md)
- [Operations and automation standard](standards/OPERATIONS_AND_AUTOMATION_STANDARD.md)
- [Collection selection guide](../VIRTUALIZATION_SELECTION_GUIDE.md)
- [Collection change lifecycle](../VIRTUALIZATION_CHANGE_LIFECYCLE.md)
- [Collection migration matrix](../MIGRATION_DECISION_MATRIX.md)
- applicable governance, language, discipline, platform, framework, and profile packages

## Supported interfaces

Prefer Oracle Linux KVM/libvirt tooling, virsh, Cockpit where supported, OLVM REST APIs, supported SDKs, Ansible, and engine backup procedures.

Pin or constrain automation dependencies when practical. Verify interface, server, and API compatibility against current official documentation. Do not use screen scraping, direct manager-database edits, undocumented endpoints, or manual edits to manager-owned state.

## Lifecycle and compatibility

Verify Oracle Linux release, UEK or RHCK kernel boundary, KVM/QEMU/libvirt, OLVM release, hardware certification, Oracle VirtIO drivers, guest support, storage, networking, migration, API, and support entitlement.

Record the exact versions and source-review date. Do not rely on remembered compatibility, feature, licensing, or support claims.

## Non-negotiable behavior

- Discover inventory, versions, health, alarms, events, tasks, capacity, backup, and dependencies before mutation.
- Resolve stable IDs and parent scope; reject ambiguous name-only matches.
- Separate discovery, validation, preview, reporting, execution, verification, and recovery.
- Require explicit authorization for power, deletion, disk, snapshot, checkpoint, network, storage, host, cluster, failover, replication, or migration changes.
- Verify independent backup or export and recovery readiness before destructive or high-blast-radius work.
- Treat snapshots and checkpoints as short-lived operational mechanisms, not backups by default.
- Bound concurrency, polling, retries, and timeouts.
- Preserve task, event, audit, and correlation identifiers.
- Redact credentials, tokens, certificates, console data, support bundles, and sensitive inventory.
- Verify actual platform and workload state after task completion.
- Record checks not run, limitations, operator interventions, and residual risk.
- Do not claim zero downtime, recoverability, compatibility, supportability, or production readiness without evidence.

## Product-specific cautions

- Do not mix direct libvirt ownership with OLVM-managed objects unless Oracle documents the operation.
- Do not assume upstream oVirt or generic KVM procedures are supported unchanged by Oracle.
- Protect OLVM engine backup and recovery before manager, cluster, or storage changes.

## Product rules

### VIRT-OLKVM-MODE-001

**Requirement:** Identify standalone libvirt versus OLVM management before mutation and reject conflicting ownership.

**Expected evidence:** Manager mode, URI or OLVM scope, stable object IDs, and identity evidence.

### VIRT-OLKVM-KERNEL-002

**Requirement:** Verify Oracle Linux, kernel, KVM, QEMU, libvirt, firmware, and hardware certification compatibility.

**Expected evidence:** Installed versions and current Oracle compatibility sources.

### VIRT-OLKVM-ENGINE-003

**Requirement:** Protect and test OLVM engine backup and recovery before managed-environment lifecycle work.

**Expected evidence:** Engine backup, restore procedure, and recovery evidence.

### VIRT-OLKVM-STOR-004

**Requirement:** Validate storage pool or domain ownership, paths, capacity, multipathing, and backup before mutation.

**Expected evidence:** Storage mapping, health, capacity, and recovery evidence.

### VIRT-OLKVM-API-005

**Requirement:** Use supported Oracle Linux or OLVM interfaces and verify actual state after tasks.

**Expected evidence:** Interface version, task/event records, and post-change state.

## Required working method

1. Identify authority, target, versions, owners, and current state without mutation.
2. Validate health, privileges, compatibility, capacity, backup, recovery, and maintenance window.
3. Produce an exact plan or dry-run with selected object IDs and ordered actions.
4. Review power, deletion, privilege, network, storage, availability, licensing, and support effects.
5. Obtain accountable authorization for the exact plan and target.
6. Execute through supported interfaces with bounded concurrency and stop conditions.
7. Verify manager, host, VM, guest, network, storage, backup, and monitoring state.
8. Observe outcomes for a risk-proportionate interval.
9. Preserve evidence and disclose deviations and residual risk.

## Automation requirements

Custom automation must:

- default to non-mutating discovery
- provide validation and dry-run or plan behavior
- require explicit execution enablement
- support confirmation semantics when the language and interface permit
- use structured configuration, input, logging, and reports
- handle missing, duplicate, stale, disconnected, unauthorized, unhealthy, and disappearing objects
- classify retryable and terminal failures
- be safe to rerun or clearly document manual recovery
- test positive, negative, partial-failure, and recovery paths
- document exact supported product and interface versions

## Decision gates

Stop when target identity, authority, health, compatibility, capacity, backup, recovery, support, or authorization is unresolved.

## Completion evidence

Record:

- selected package and exact product boundary
- endpoint and object scope without sensitive identifiers
- acting identity class and authorization
- versions, edition, lifecycle, and sources checked
- before, intended, and actual state
- task and event identifiers
- power, network, storage, availability, licensing, and recovery impact
- exact validation and results
- actual-state and workload verification
- rollback, restore, failback, or rebuild readiness
- checks not run, limitations, owners, reviewers, and residual risk
