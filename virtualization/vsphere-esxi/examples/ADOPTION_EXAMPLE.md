# VMware vSphere and ESXi Adoption Example

## Boundary

This fictitious example demonstrates adoption structure only.

- Manager: `virt-mgr.example.invalid`
- Environment: `training-lab`
- Cluster or pool: `cluster-lab-01`
- Host: `hv-lab-01.example.invalid`
- Workload: `vm-sample-01`
- Change: validate a planned host-maintenance workflow
- Mode: discovery, validation, and dry-run only
- Live execution: not authorized

## Selected standards

- root governance
- virtualization collection guidance
- VMware vSphere and ESXi package
- applicable language package for the automation
- testing, application-security, observability, SRE, documentation, and internal-automation guidance

## Discovery evidence

The fictitious automation records the manager class, cluster and host stable IDs, product versions, health, active tasks, guest ownership, backup status, capacity, network/storage dependencies, and maintenance blockers.

No state changes occur.

## Validation

The workflow fails closed when:

- the manager certificate or environment does not match
- the host match is missing or ambiguous
- cluster or manager health is degraded
- a conflicting task is active
- evacuation capacity is insufficient
- backup or recovery evidence is missing
- a pinned device or workload cannot move
- authorization is absent

## Dry-run report

The report lists:

- selected stable objects
- workloads that could move
- workloads blocked from moving
- capacity before and projected during maintenance
- expected tasks
- network and storage dependencies
- stop conditions
- recovery path
- checks not run

## Result

The example stops after reviewable dry-run output. It does not place the host into maintenance mode, migrate a workload, change power state, alter storage or networking, or claim production readiness.

## Adaptation warning

Replace fictitious values only inside an adopting repository with reviewed configuration and authorization. Re-run official compatibility and lifecycle verification for the exact installed product.
