# Web API Composition Example

## Purpose

A moderate-risk containerized ASP.NET Core API demonstrating contract, security, privacy, observability, and delivery standards.

This directory demonstrates a complete standards composition, including selection rationale, project tailoring, scoped agent instructions, architecture, risk, tests, operations, and schema-shaped evidence. It contains no production application code.

## Fictitious project summary

- **Profile:** [WEB_API](../../profiles/WEB_API.md)
- **Risk classification:** `moderate`
- **Implementation status:** documentation-only example
- **Production readiness:** not assessed and not claimed
- **Data:** The fictitious API processes account identifiers and operational metadata. No real personal data, secrets, or internal endpoints are included.

## Learning goals

Use this example to understand how to:

- select standards based on project shape and risk
- document why each package applies
- convert shared standards into project-specific instructions
- use nested `AGENTS.md` files to narrow scope
- describe architecture and trust boundaries without inventing environment facts
- define validation before implementation
- record limitations, checks not run, and residual risk
- use repository schemas for machine-readable evidence

## Selected profile

[WEB_API](../../profiles/WEB_API.md) provides the project-type overlay. It supplements rather than replaces governance, language, discipline, platform, and framework standards.

## Selected languages

- [.NET](../../languages/dotnet/)

Language packages define runtime, coding, dependency, testing, security, documentation, and completion expectations for implementation work.

## Selected disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture and System Design](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [API Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Privacy and Data Governance](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [CI/CD](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Software Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

The selection rationale is documented in [`composition/STANDARDS_SELECTION.md`](composition/STANDARDS_SELECTION.md). Omitting a discipline requires a reason; absence from a job title is not a reason.

## Selected platforms

- [Containers](../../platforms/containers/)

## Selected frameworks

- [ASP.NET Core](../../frameworks/aspnet-core/)

## Architecture summary

- **HTTP API:** Exposes versioned JSON endpoints and machine-readable contracts.
- **Application services:** Implements use cases behind explicit interfaces.
- **Persistence adapter:** Uses parameterized data access and bounded transactions.
- **Telemetry boundary:** Produces structured logs, metrics, traces, and health signals.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for responsibilities, dependencies, trust boundaries, state, and failure behavior.

## Trust boundaries

- Internet or network clients
- Authentication provider
- Database or external service
- Container runtime and deployment environment

Every real adoption must replace these fictitious boundaries with reviewed project facts.

## Root instructions

[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) defines:

- instruction precedence
- allowed and prohibited scope
- project facts
- mandatory working method
- safety and evidence requirements
- change-classification and completion gates
- links to the selected standards packages

## Nested instructions

- `src/api/AGENTS.md`: API implementation scope
- `tests/AGENTS.md`: Test scope
- `deploy/AGENTS.md`: Deployment scope
- `docs/AGENTS.md`: Documentation scope

Nested instructions add local constraints. They do not weaken root or shared standards.

## Composition and tailoring

- [`STANDARDS_SELECTION.md`](composition/STANDARDS_SELECTION.md) explains why packages were selected.
- [`TAILORING_DECISIONS.md`](composition/TAILORING_DECISIONS.md) records project facts, owners, assumptions, inapplicable controls, and unresolved decisions.
- [`project-manifest.json`](project-manifest.json) provides the machine-readable package selection.

A real project must review all three together. Contradictory narrative and manifest files are not “flexibility”; they are drift.

## Common documentation

- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [`RISK_ASSESSMENT.md`](docs/RISK_ASSESSMENT.md)
- [`TEST_STRATEGY.md`](docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md)
- [`OPERATIONS.md`](docs/OPERATIONS.md)
- [`COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](docs/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md)

Additional example-specific documents:

- [`THREAT_MODEL.md`](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md)
- [`DATA_HANDLING.md`](docs/DATA_HANDLING.md)
- [`RELEASE_PLAN.md`](docs/RELEASE_PLAN.md)

## Validation baseline

The example proposes the following project validations:

- Restore, format, build, and test the .NET solution
- Contract and negative authorization tests
- Container build and non-root runtime checks
- Dependency and secret scanning
- Health, telemetry, and safe-error verification

The commands and outcomes in this example are illustrative. An adopting project must use actual repository commands and record whether each check passed, failed, or was not run.

## Evidence files

- [`completion-result.example.json`](evidence/completion-result.example.json) follows the [completion-result schema](../../schemas/completion-result.schema.json).
- [`test-evidence.example.json`](evidence/test-evidence.example.json) follows the [test-evidence schema](../../schemas/test-evidence.schema.json).
- [`artifact-record.example.json`](evidence/artifact-record.example.json) follows the [artifact-record schema](../../schemas/artifact-record.schema.json).

Example digests, commits, runs, timestamps, and reviewers are fictitious or explicitly marked as not verified.

## How to adapt this example

1. Replace the fictitious project name and summary.
2. Reclassify risk using actual impact and reversibility.
3. Re-select the profile, languages, disciplines, platforms, and frameworks.
4. Replace architecture and trust-boundary assumptions with reviewed facts.
5. Define actual owners and approval paths.
6. Replace example commands with repository commands.
7. Define real environments and test data.
8. Add or remove nested scopes based on the real directory structure.
9. Replace example evidence with actual results.
10. Record exceptions, limitations, and checks not run.
11. Validate the repository.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## What not to copy

Do not copy:

- fictitious names or identifiers as though they were approved
- example risk classifications without reassessment
- placeholder ownership or reviewer values
- example evidence as proof
- platform or framework selections that do not apply
- operational claims that were not tested
- any statement implying certification, compliance, or production approval

## Known limitations

- No real authentication provider, database, network, or cloud environment is configured.
- The example does not claim compliance with any law or certification.
- Performance, recovery, and production deployment remain unverified.

## Review checklist

Before using the composition:

- [ ] The manifest matches the actual project.
- [ ] Every selected standard is applicable.
- [ ] Every omitted standard has a defensible reason.
- [ ] Root and nested instructions do not conflict.
- [ ] Architecture and trust boundaries are accurate.
- [ ] Risk and evidence requirements are proportionate.
- [ ] Validation commands are executable.
- [ ] Example evidence has been replaced.
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive production values are present.
- [ ] Limitations and residual risks are explicit.
- [ ] Accountable reviewers are identified.

## Validation of this standards repository

From the repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

## Non-production warning

This example is educational. It does not implement web api composition example, prove the selected controls, validate a deployment, or replace accountable engineering review.
