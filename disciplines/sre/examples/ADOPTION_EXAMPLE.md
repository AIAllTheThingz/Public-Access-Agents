# Site Reliability Engineering Adoption Example

This example shows composition, not a universal project design.

## Example project

A fictitious project determines that the **Site Reliability Engineering** discipline applies because:

- a service or operational workflow has availability or recovery expectations
- on-call support exists
- dependency, scaling, saturation, or incident risk is material

The project composes:

- root governance standards
- one applicable language package
- one project profile
- this discipline package
- the [`Observability`](../../observability/) discipline
- the [`Architecture and System Design`](../../architecture/) discipline
- the [`CI/CD`](../../ci-cd/) discipline

## Tailored project instructions

The project `AGENTS.md` adds:

- named owners and reviewers
- exact supported environments and boundaries
- project-specific tools and validation commands
- required evidence locations
- compatibility, migration, rollback, recovery, and support constraints
- stricter rules required by the organization

It does not remove shared controls merely because they are inconvenient.

## Example evidence summary

- defined SLOs or operating targets
- capacity and saturation evidence
- recovery and failover tests
- reviewed runbooks and escalation
- documented reliability risks

The completion report also lists checks not run, known limitations, accepted exceptions, residual risks, and follow-up owners.

All project names, targets, users, and values in an adopted example must be fictitious or approved for public documentation.
