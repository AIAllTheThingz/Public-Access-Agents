# Desktop Application Project Profile Package

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for installed desktop applications that execute on user-managed endpoints and may store data, integrate with the operating system, or update independently.

This package is a project-shape overlay. It composes governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and project-specific standards into a coherent starting point.

Status: **baseline**

## Canonical profile

The stable profile entry point is [`../DESKTOP_APPLICATION.md`](../DESKTOP_APPLICATION.md).

The canonical file provides the normative summary. This package supplies the detailed adoption model, standards, templates, and example.

## When to adopt

Adopt this profile when:

- native desktop applications
- cross-platform desktop applications
- administrative consoles
- endpoint utilities with graphical interfaces

Do not use it as the primary profile for:

- browser-only applications
- mobile applications
- headless command-line tools

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

Reclassify using actual project facts. Escalate for public exposure, privilege, destructive capability, sensitive data, tenant boundaries, weak rollback, availability, safety, or incomplete evidence.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- governance authority and risk classification
- architecture and threat modeling
- language or framework standards
- platform ownership
- discipline packages
- organization policy or legal obligations
- project-specific tests and evidence
- production-readiness approval

## Normative entry points

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`../DESKTOP_APPLICATION.md`](../DESKTOP_APPLICATION.md)
- [`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md)

## Required disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture and System Design](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Accessibility](../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Privacy and Data Governance](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional disciplines

- [Software Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [CI/CD](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Integration Engineering](../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Database Engineering](../../disciplines/database/)

A conditional discipline becomes required when its concern exists. “Another team handles that” is a responsibility statement only when the boundary and evidence are explicit.

## Language, framework, and platform selection

This profile intentionally does not choose a language, framework, or platform.

The adopting project must declare:

- implementation languages
- frameworks
- execution and deployment platforms
- supported versions
- package and dependency management
- build and release tooling
- compatibility commitments
- operational ownership

## Required project decisions

- local data protection
- installer and update integrity
- privilege and elevation boundaries
- secure storage and credential integration
- accessibility and keyboard behavior
- offline and degraded operation
- telemetry and privacy
- supported operating systems and migration

## Architecture and trust boundaries

Document:

- user interface and process boundaries
- local storage
- OS integration and privileged helpers
- remote services and update channels
- plugin or extension boundaries
- installer and recovery model

Use [`standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md`](standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md) and [`standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md`](standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md).

## Security and privacy expectations

- least privilege and elevation
- secure local storage
- signed packages and updates
- safe IPC, file, URI, and protocol handling
- secret exclusion from logs and crash reports
- tamper and rollback considerations

Use [`standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md`](standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md).

## Testing and validation expectations

- supported OS coverage
- installation, upgrade, repair, and uninstall
- accessibility and keyboard behavior
- offline and network failure
- privilege boundaries
- data migration and recovery

Use [`standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md`](standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md).

## Operations and release expectations

- crash and diagnostic collection
- update rollout and rollback
- support bundles and redaction
- version and compatibility support
- local data recovery
- release and end-of-support communication

Use [`standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md`](standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Suggested nested instructions

Consider scoped `AGENTS.md` files under:

- src/ui
- src/core
- src/platform
- tests
- docs
- installer

Nested instructions specialize local work. They may be stricter but may not silently weaken governance or the selected packages.

## Common failure modes

- running elevated by default
- unsigned or unverified updates
- sensitive local files with weak permissions
- inaccessible custom controls
- unsafe file or URI handlers
- untested upgrade and rollback

Other recurring failures include copying example facts, treating a profile as architecture approval, omitting conditional packages without justification, and claiming completion from partial evidence.

## Adoption workflow

1. Read root governance and the [profile collection guide](../README.md).
2. Confirm this is the primary or a scoped secondary profile.
3. Record profile-selection rationale.
4. Classify risk.
5. Select applicable language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, and networking packages.
6. Complete the adoption checklist.
7. Document architecture, security, tests, operations, and release decisions.
8. Add nested instructions for distinct scopes.
9. Define exact validation commands and evidence.
10. Review exclusions and exceptions.
11. Validate links, IDs, manifests, and project behavior.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- project purpose and non-goals
- users and operators
- interfaces and trust boundaries
- data and privacy
- identities and privileges
- state and storage
- dependencies and integrations
- deployment and environments
- supported versions
- validation and test environments
- observability and support
- recovery and migration
- release and compatibility
- evidence retention
- reviewers and approvers

## Evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- profile rationale
- selected and omitted packages
- risk
- changed scope
- decisions
- validation commands and results
- representative environments
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval
- production-readiness status

## Common validation

From the standards repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

The adopting project must define executable checks for its real implementation.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Examples are fictitious. Replace them with reviewed facts and actual evidence.

## Maintenance

Package changes must preserve stable IDs, update canonical and package files together, state migration impact, validate links, and disclose checks not run.

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that the project is complete or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, validation, evidence, and accountable review.
