# Web Application Project Profile Adoption Example

## Fictitious project

This example models a non-production web application.

No production systems, identities, credentials, endpoints, data, or approval are included.

## Profile decision

- Primary profile: [`../../WEB_APPLICATION.md`](../../WEB_APPLICATION.md)
- Typical starting risk: `moderate`
- Actual risk: must be assessed by the adopting project

## Selected disciplines

- [Application Security](../../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture](../../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing](../../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Accessibility](../../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Privacy](../../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Observability](../../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Ci Cd](../../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Supply Chain](../../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional review

- [Api Engineering](../../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Database](../../../disciplines/database/)
- [Integration](../../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Sre](../../../disciplines/sre/)
- [Documentation](../../../disciplines/documentation/)

## Project decisions

- server-side authorization model
- client and server trust boundaries
- WCAG 2.2 AA or stricter accessibility target
- content security and safe rendering
- browser support and assistive-technology coverage
- session and state management
- privacy, analytics, and consent behavior
- deployment, rollback, caching, and asset compatibility

## Suggested scopes

- src/frontend
- src/backend
- tests
- docs
- public
- deploy

## Evidence boundary
