# Project Profile Risk and Evidence Matrix

## Purpose

Provides starting evidence expectations by profile. Actual governance risk classification controls.

| Profile | Typical start | High-value evidence |
|---|---:|---|
| Web API | `moderate` | authentication and authorization model, request and response contract, versioning and compatibility policy |
| Web Application | `moderate` | server-side authorization model, client and server trust boundaries, WCAG 2.2 AA or stricter accessibility target |
| Worker Service | `moderate` | idempotency and replay behavior, concurrency and ordering, cancellation and graceful shutdown |
| Command-Line Tool | `low` | safe defaults and read-only behavior, confirmation and simulation for destructive actions, human-readable and machine-readable output |
| Desktop Application | `moderate` | local data protection, installer and update integrity, privilege and elevation boundaries |
| Mobile Application | `moderate` | secure storage, network trust and certificate behavior, permission minimization |
| Serverless Function | `moderate` | event validation and schema, idempotency and duplicate delivery, timeout, retry, and dead-letter behavior |
| Data Pipeline | `high` | data contracts and ownership, lineage and metadata, replay and backfill behavior |
| Public Library | `moderate` | public API compatibility, supported runtimes and platforms, dependency minimization |
| Internal Automation | `high` | discovery and validation phases, dry-run, what-if, or preview behavior, least privilege and credential handling |
| Multi-Tenant SaaS | `high` | tenant identity and isolation model, authorization at every object boundary, data partitioning and lifecycle |
| Security Tool | `high` | authorized scope and target identity, safe handling of findings and evidence, false-positive and false-negative limitations |
| AI Agent Application | `high` | tool authorization and allowlists, prompt and retrieved-content trust boundaries, human approval for consequential actions |

## Escalation factors

Escalate risk for:

- production targets
- privileged or destructive actions
- public exposure
- sensitive or regulated data
- tenant boundaries
- irreversible migration
- broad blast radius
- weak rollback
- safety impact
- consequential AI tool use
- unsupported runtime or dependency
- missing operational owner
- incomplete evidence

## Minimum evidence across profiles

- profile selection rationale
- architecture and trust boundaries
- risk classification
- required project decisions
- package selection
- validation commands and results
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval evidence

## Decision rule

When the project shape or risk is uncertain, choose the higher plausible control set until evidence supports reduction.
