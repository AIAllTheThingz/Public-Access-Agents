# Multi-Tenant SaaS Project Profile Adoption Example

## Fictitious project

This example models a non-production multi-tenant saas.

No production systems, identities, credentials, endpoints, data, or approval are included.

## Profile decision

- Primary profile: [`../../MULTI_TENANT_SAAS.md`](../../MULTI_TENANT_SAAS.md)
- Typical starting risk: `high`
- Actual risk: must be assessed by the adopting project

## Selected disciplines

- [Application Security](../../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture](../../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing](../../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Api Engineering](../../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Database](../../../disciplines/database/)
- [Privacy](../../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Observability](../../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Sre](../../../disciplines/sre/)

## Conditional review

- [Integration](../../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Data Engineering](../../../disciplines/data-engineering/)
- [Accessibility](../../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Documentation](../../../disciplines/documentation/)

## Project decisions

- tenant identity and isolation model
- authorization at every object boundary
- data partitioning and lifecycle
- tenant export and deletion
- noisy-neighbor and quota controls
- tenant-aware telemetry and support
- billing and entitlement boundaries
- migration, rollout, and recovery by tenant

## Suggested scopes

- src/tenant
- src/api
- src/data
- tests
- docs
- deploy

## Evidence boundary
