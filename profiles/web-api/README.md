# Web API Project Profile Package

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for HTTP, RPC, event-facing, or other programmatic service interfaces that expose business or operational capabilities.

This package is a project-shape overlay. It composes governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, and project-specific standards into a coherent starting point.

Status: **baseline**

## Canonical profile

The stable profile entry point is [`../WEB_API.md`](../WEB_API.md).

The canonical file provides the normative summary. This package supplies the detailed adoption model, standards, templates, and example.

## When to adopt

Adopt this profile when:

- public and internal HTTP APIs
- RPC or service interfaces
- backend-for-frontend services
- webhook receivers and callback endpoints
- API gateways when application behavior is implemented in the repository

Do not use it as the primary profile for:

- a public library with no deployed service boundary
- static documentation or content-only sites
- a worker with no externally callable interface

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

Reclassify using actual project facts. Escalate for public exposure, privilege, destructive capability, sensitive data, tenant boundaries, weak rollback, availability, safety, or incomplete evidence.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- governance authority and risk classification
- architecture and threat modeling
- language or framework standards
- platform ownership
- discipline packages
- organization policy or legal obligations
- project-specific tests and evidence
- production-readiness approval

## Normative entry points

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`../WEB_API.md`](../WEB_API.md)
- [`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md)

## Required disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Api Engineering](../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Privacy](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Ci Cd](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional disciplines

- [Database](../../disciplines/database/)
- [Integration](../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Sre](../../disciplines/sre/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [Data Engineering](../../disciplines/data-engineering/)

A conditional discipline becomes required when its concern exists. “Another team handles that” is a responsibility statement only when the boundary and evidence are explicit.

## Language, framework, and platform selection

This profile intentionally does not choose a language, framework, or platform.

The adopting project must declare:

- implementation languages
- frameworks
- execution and deployment platforms
- supported versions
- package and dependency management
- build and release tooling
- compatibility commitments
- operational ownership

## Required project decisions

- authentication and authorization model
- request and response contract
- versioning and compatibility policy
- validation, size, pagination, and rate limits
- idempotency and retry semantics
- error contract and diagnostic boundary
- data classification and retention
- health, telemetry, deployment, rollback, and ownership

## Architecture and trust boundaries

Document:

- client and caller boundaries
- routing and endpoint ownership
- business-service boundaries
- data stores and external dependencies
- identity provider and authorization boundary
- deployment and observability boundaries

Use [`standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md`](standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md) and [`standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md`](standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md).

## Security and privacy expectations

- server-side authorization for every protected operation
- input validation at the trust boundary
- safe serialization and error behavior
- abuse, rate, resource, and automation controls
- secret and credential handling
- privacy and logging boundaries

Use [`standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md`](standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md).

## Testing and validation expectations

- contract and compatibility tests
- positive and negative authorization tests
- validation and boundary tests
- integration and dependency-failure tests
- idempotency, retry, timeout, and cancellation tests
- deployment and health validation

Use [`standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md`](standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md).

## Operations and release expectations

- versioned deployment and rollback
- health, metrics, logs, traces, and correlation
- rate-limit and abuse monitoring
- dependency and quota ownership
- runbooks and escalation
- release notes and migration guidance

Use [`standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md`](standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Suggested nested instructions

Consider scoped `AGENTS.md` files under:

- src/api
- src/domain
- src/infrastructure
- tests
- docs
- deploy

Nested instructions specialize local work. They may be stricter but may not silently weaken governance or the selected packages.

## Common failure modes

- treating authentication as authorization
- relying on client-side validation
- undocumented breaking changes
- unbounded payloads or queries
- leaking internal errors or sensitive data
- declaring success from unit tests alone

Other recurring failures include copying example facts, treating a profile as architecture approval, omitting conditional packages without justification, and claiming completion from partial evidence.

## Adoption workflow

1. Read root governance and the [profile collection guide](../README.md).
2. Confirm this is the primary or a scoped secondary profile.
3. Record profile-selection rationale.
4. Classify risk.
5. Select language, discipline, framework, and platform packages.
6. Complete the adoption checklist.
7. Document architecture, security, tests, operations, and release decisions.
8. Add nested instructions for distinct scopes.
9. Define exact validation commands and evidence.
10. Review exclusions and exceptions.
11. Validate links, IDs, manifests, and project behavior.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- project purpose and non-goals
- users and operators
- interfaces and trust boundaries
- data and privacy
- identities and privileges
- state and storage
- dependencies and integrations
- deployment and environments
- supported versions
- validation and test environments
- observability and support
- recovery and migration
- release and compatibility
- evidence retention
- reviewers and approvers

## Evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- profile rationale
- selected and omitted packages
- risk
- changed scope
- decisions
- validation commands and results
- representative environments
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval
- production-readiness status

## Common validation

From the standards repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

The adopting project must define executable checks for its real implementation.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Examples are fictitious. Replace them with reviewed facts and actual evidence.

## Maintenance

Package changes must preserve stable IDs, update canonical and package files together, state migration impact, validate links, and disclose checks not run.

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that the project is complete or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, validation, evidence, and accountable review.
