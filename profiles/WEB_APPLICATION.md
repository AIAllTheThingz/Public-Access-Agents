# Web Application Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for browser-delivered applications with interactive user experiences, client and server trust boundaries, and accessibility obligations.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`web-application/`](web-application/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- single-page applications
- server-rendered web applications
- progressive web applications
- browser-based administrative tools
- full-stack web applications

It normally does not describe:

- content-only static pages with no application behavior
- native desktop or mobile applications
- backend services with no browser interface

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/accessibility/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/observability/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/api-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/database/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/integration/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/sre/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/documentation/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- server-side authorization model
- client and server trust boundaries
- WCAG 2.2 AA or stricter accessibility target
- content security and safe rendering
- browser support and assistive-technology coverage
- session and state management
- privacy, analytics, and consent behavior
- deployment, rollback, caching, and asset compatibility

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- browser and server boundaries
- frontend state and routing
- API and identity integration
- content delivery and caching
- data stores and third-party scripts
- deployment and observability boundaries

## Security and privacy focus

- server-side authorization
- XSS and unsafe HTML controls
- CSRF or antiforgery where applicable
- content security policy and third-party script governance
- secret exclusion from client bundles
- privacy-safe analytics and diagnostics

## Testing and validation

- keyboard and focus testing
- screen-reader and semantic review
- unit and component tests
- browser integration and end-to-end tests
- negative authorization and security tests
- asset, cache, deployment, and rollback checks

## Operations and release

- client error and performance telemetry
- release compatibility across cached assets
- feature-flag and rollback behavior
- accessibility regression handling
- browser support ownership
- incident and support runbooks

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/frontend/AGENTS.md`
- `src/backend/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `public/AGENTS.md`
- `deploy/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
