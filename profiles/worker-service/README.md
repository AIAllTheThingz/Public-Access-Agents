# Worker Service Project Profile Package

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for long-running or scheduled background processes that consume work, coordinate dependencies, and operate without an interactive user request.

This package is a project-shape overlay. It composes governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and project-specific standards into a coherent starting point.

Status: **baseline**

## Canonical profile

The stable profile entry point is [`../WORKER_SERVICE.md`](../WORKER_SERVICE.md).

The canonical file provides the normative summary. This package supplies the detailed adoption model, standards, templates, and example.

## When to adopt

Adopt this profile when:

- message consumers
- queue workers
- scheduled services
- background processors
- batch coordinators and durable jobs

Do not use it as the primary profile for:

- single-use administrative scripts
- interactive command-line tools
- request-only web APIs without background work

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

Reclassify using actual project facts. Escalate for public exposure, privilege, destructive capability, sensitive data, tenant boundaries, weak rollback, availability, safety, or incomplete evidence.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- governance authority and risk classification
- architecture and threat modeling
- language or framework standards
- platform ownership
- discipline packages
- organization policy or legal obligations
- project-specific tests and evidence
- production-readiness approval

## Normative entry points

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`../WORKER_SERVICE.md`](../WORKER_SERVICE.md)
- [`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md)

## Required disciplines

- [Architecture and System Design](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Integration Engineering](../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Site Reliability Engineering](../../disciplines/sre/)
- [CI/CD](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Software Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Database Engineering](../../disciplines/database/)
- [Data Engineering](../../disciplines/data-engineering/)
- [Privacy and Data Governance](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)

A conditional discipline becomes required when its concern exists. “Another team handles that” is a responsibility statement only when the boundary and evidence are explicit.

## Language, framework, and platform selection

This profile intentionally does not choose a language, framework, or platform.

The adopting project must declare:

- implementation languages
- frameworks
- execution and deployment platforms
- supported versions
- package and dependency management
- build and release tooling
- compatibility commitments
- operational ownership

## Required project decisions

- idempotency and replay behavior
- concurrency and ordering
- cancellation and graceful shutdown
- retry, backoff, poison-message, and dead-letter behavior
- checkpoint and state ownership
- dependency failure and partial success
- health and readiness
- operational ownership, scaling, and recovery

## Architecture and trust boundaries

Document:

- work source and delivery semantics
- worker ownership and concurrency model
- external dependency boundaries
- state, checkpoint, and deduplication stores
- deployment and scaling model
- telemetry and operational control plane

Use [`standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md`](standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md) and [`standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md`](standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md).

## Security and privacy expectations

- work-item validation
- least-privilege workload identity
- secret handling
- sensitive payload and log boundaries
- authorization for consequential actions
- resource exhaustion and abuse controls

Use [`standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md`](standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md).

## Testing and validation expectations

- idempotency and duplicate delivery
- reordering and concurrency
- retry and dead-letter paths
- cancellation and shutdown
- dependency outages and timeouts
- scaling, recovery, and operational checks

Use [`standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md`](standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md).

## Operations and release expectations

- lag, throughput, error, retry, and dead-letter metrics
- health and readiness semantics
- capacity and backpressure
- runbooks and replay procedures
- deployment drain and rollback
- incident ownership and recovery

Use [`standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md`](standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Suggested nested instructions

Consider scoped `AGENTS.md` files under:

- src/worker
- src/integrations
- src/storage
- tests
- docs
- deploy

Nested instructions specialize local work. They may be stricter but may not silently weaken governance or the selected packages.

## Common failure modes

- non-idempotent handlers
- unbounded retries
- lost cancellation
- acknowledging before durable completion
- logging sensitive payloads
- no owner for poison messages or replay

Other recurring failures include copying example facts, treating a profile as architecture approval, omitting conditional packages without justification, and claiming completion from partial evidence.

## Adoption workflow

1. Read root governance and the [profile collection guide](../README.md).
2. Confirm this is the primary or a scoped secondary profile.
3. Record profile-selection rationale.
4. Classify risk.
5. Select applicable language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, and networking packages.
6. Complete the adoption checklist.
7. Document architecture, security, tests, operations, and release decisions.
8. Add nested instructions for distinct scopes.
9. Define exact validation commands and evidence.
10. Review exclusions and exceptions.
11. Validate links, IDs, manifests, and project behavior.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- project purpose and non-goals
- users and operators
- interfaces and trust boundaries
- data and privacy
- identities and privileges
- state and storage
- dependencies and integrations
- deployment and environments
- supported versions
- validation and test environments
- observability and support
- recovery and migration
- release and compatibility
- evidence retention
- reviewers and approvers

## Evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- profile rationale
- selected and omitted packages
- risk
- changed scope
- decisions
- validation commands and results
- representative environments
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval
- production-readiness status

## Common validation

From the standards repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

The adopting project must define executable checks for its real implementation.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Examples are fictitious. Replace them with reviewed facts and actual evidence.

## Maintenance

Package changes must preserve stable IDs, update canonical and package files together, state migration impact, validate links, and disclose checks not run.

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that the project is complete or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, validation, evidence, and accountable review.
