# Multi-Tenant SaaS Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for hosted software serving multiple tenants with isolation, authorization, data lifecycle, quota, billing, and operational obligations.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`multi-tenant-saas/`](multi-tenant-saas/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- shared-application multi-tenant SaaS
- shared-database or isolated-database tenant models
- tenant-aware APIs and web applications
- hosted platforms with tenant administration

It normally does not describe:

- single-tenant internal applications
- public libraries
- consumer applications without tenant boundaries

## Typical starting risk

`high`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/api-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/database/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/observability/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/sre/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/integration/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/data-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/accessibility/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/documentation/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- tenant identity and isolation model
- authorization at every object boundary
- data partitioning and lifecycle
- tenant export and deletion
- noisy-neighbor and quota controls
- tenant-aware telemetry and support
- billing and entitlement boundaries
- migration, rollout, and recovery by tenant

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- tenant resolution
- authorization and policy enforcement
- data partitioning
- shared and tenant-specific services
- administration and support
- billing, telemetry, and deployment boundaries

## Security and privacy focus

- cross-tenant access prevention
- object-level authorization
- tenant-scoped keys and secrets where applicable
- support and impersonation controls
- safe tenant identifiers in logs
- abuse and quota controls

## Testing and validation

- cross-tenant negative tests
- tenant provisioning and deletion
- schema and migration by tenant
- quota and noisy-neighbor behavior
- support and admin access
- backup, restore, and export isolation

## Operations and release

- tenant-aware health and telemetry
- incident scoping and communication
- per-tenant rollout and rollback
- capacity and cost allocation
- data lifecycle operations
- support and escalation

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/tenant/AGENTS.md`
- `src/api/AGENTS.md`
- `src/data/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `deploy/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, platform, framework, discipline, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
