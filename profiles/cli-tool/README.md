# Command-Line Tool Project Profile Package

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for command-line tools used by humans or automation, including safe input, output, exit codes, configuration, and state-changing behavior.

This package is a project-shape overlay. It composes governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and project-specific standards into a coherent starting point.

Status: **baseline**

## Canonical profile

The stable profile entry point is [`../CLI_TOOL.md`](../CLI_TOOL.md).

The canonical file provides the normative summary. This package supplies the detailed adoption model, standards, templates, and example.

## When to adopt

Adopt this profile when:

- administrative CLIs
- developer tools
- data-processing commands
- automation entry points
- local and remote operational utilities

Do not use it as the primary profile for:

- embedded libraries with no command interface
- graphical desktop applications
- long-running background services

## Typical starting risk

`low`

Reclassify using actual project facts. Escalate for public exposure, privilege, destructive capability, sensitive data, tenant boundaries, weak rollback, availability, safety, or incomplete evidence.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- governance authority and risk classification
- architecture and threat modeling
- language or framework standards
- platform ownership
- discipline packages
- organization policy or legal obligations
- project-specific tests and evidence
- production-readiness approval

## Normative entry points

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`../CLI_TOOL.md`](../CLI_TOOL.md)
- [`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md)

## Required disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Testing and Quality Engineering](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [Software Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional disciplines

- [Architecture and System Design](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Integration Engineering](../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [CI/CD](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Privacy and Data Governance](../../disciplines/privacy/)

A conditional discipline becomes required when its concern exists. “Another team handles that” is a responsibility statement only when the boundary and evidence are explicit.

## Language, framework, and platform selection

This profile intentionally does not choose a language, framework, or platform.

The adopting project must declare:

- implementation languages
- frameworks
- execution and deployment platforms
- supported versions
- package and dependency management
- build and release tooling
- compatibility commitments
- operational ownership

## Required project decisions

- safe defaults and read-only behavior
- confirmation and simulation for destructive actions
- human-readable and machine-readable output
- exit-code contract
- configuration and credential sources
- local and remote target identity
- idempotency, rollback, and cleanup
- packaging, signing, and update model

## Architecture and trust boundaries

Document:

- command parsing and dispatch
- domain operations
- external adapters
- configuration and credential boundaries
- output and reporting
- packaging and distribution

Use [`standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md`](standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md) and [`standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md`](standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md).

## Security and privacy expectations

- argument and path validation
- command and query injection prevention
- credential exposure prevention
- target confirmation
- least privilege
- safe temporary files and cleanup

Use [`standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md`](standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md).

## Testing and validation expectations

- parser and validation tests
- exit codes and output formats
- dry-run and confirmation
- failure and cleanup paths
- cross-platform behavior where claimed
- packaging and installation

Use [`standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md`](standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md).

## Operations and release expectations

- structured logs or diagnostics where appropriate
- supportable error messages
- version reporting
- rollback and recovery for modifying operations
- audit records for consequential work
- release and deprecation guidance

Use [`standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md`](standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Suggested nested instructions

Consider scoped `AGENTS.md` files under:

- src
- tests
- docs
- packaging
- scripts

Nested instructions specialize local work. They may be stricter but may not silently weaken governance or the selected packages.

## Common failure modes

- destructive default behavior
- ambiguous target selection
- secrets in command lines or logs
- unstable exit codes
- mixing diagnostics with machine output
- claiming portability without testing

Other recurring failures include copying example facts, treating a profile as architecture approval, omitting conditional packages without justification, and claiming completion from partial evidence.

## Adoption workflow

1. Read root governance and the [profile collection guide](../README.md).
2. Confirm this is the primary or a scoped secondary profile.
3. Record profile-selection rationale.
4. Classify risk.
5. Select applicable language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, and networking packages.
6. Complete the adoption checklist.
7. Document architecture, security, tests, operations, and release decisions.
8. Add nested instructions for distinct scopes.
9. Define exact validation commands and evidence.
10. Review exclusions and exceptions.
11. Validate links, IDs, manifests, and project behavior.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- project purpose and non-goals
- users and operators
- interfaces and trust boundaries
- data and privacy
- identities and privileges
- state and storage
- dependencies and integrations
- deployment and environments
- supported versions
- validation and test environments
- observability and support
- recovery and migration
- release and compatibility
- evidence retention
- reviewers and approvers

## Evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- profile rationale
- selected and omitted packages
- risk
- changed scope
- decisions
- validation commands and results
- representative environments
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval
- production-readiness status

## Common validation

From the standards repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

The adopting project must define executable checks for its real implementation.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Examples are fictitious. Replace them with reviewed facts and actual evidence.

## Maintenance

Package changes must preserve stable IDs, update canonical and package files together, state migration impact, validate links, and disclose checks not run.

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that the project is complete or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, validation, evidence, and accountable review.
