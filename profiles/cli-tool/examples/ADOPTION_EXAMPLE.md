# Command-Line Tool Project Profile Adoption Example

## Fictitious project

This example models a non-production command-line tool.

No production systems, identities, credentials, endpoints, data, or approval are included.

## Profile decision

- Primary profile: [`../../CLI_TOOL.md`](../../CLI_TOOL.md)
- Typical starting risk: `low`
- Actual risk: must be assessed by the adopting project

## Selected disciplines

- [Application Security](../../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Testing](../../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Documentation](../../../disciplines/documentation/)
- [Supply Chain](../../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional review

- [Architecture](../../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Integration](../../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Observability](../../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Ci Cd](../../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Privacy](../../../disciplines/privacy/)

## Project decisions

- safe defaults and read-only behavior
- confirmation and simulation for destructive actions
- human-readable and machine-readable output
- exit-code contract
- configuration and credential sources
- local and remote target identity
- idempotency, rollback, and cleanup
- packaging, signing, and update model

## Suggested scopes

- src
- tests
- docs
- packaging
- scripts

## Evidence boundary

The example demonstrates composition only. It does not prove implementation, validation, review, approval, operational verification, or production readiness.
