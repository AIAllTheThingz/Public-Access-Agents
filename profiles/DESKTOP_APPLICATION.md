# Desktop Application Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for installed desktop applications that execute on user-managed endpoints and may store data, integrate with the operating system, or update independently.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`desktop-application/`](desktop-application/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- native desktop applications
- cross-platform desktop applications
- administrative consoles
- endpoint utilities with graphical interfaces

It normally does not describe:

- browser-only applications
- mobile applications
- headless command-line tools

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/accessibility/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/documentation/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/observability/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/integration/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/database/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- local data protection
- installer and update integrity
- privilege and elevation boundaries
- secure storage and credential integration
- accessibility and keyboard behavior
- offline and degraded operation
- telemetry and privacy
- supported operating systems and migration

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- user interface and process boundaries
- local storage
- OS integration and privileged helpers
- remote services and update channels
- plugin or extension boundaries
- installer and recovery model

## Security and privacy focus

- least privilege and elevation
- secure local storage
- signed packages and updates
- safe IPC, file, URI, and protocol handling
- secret exclusion from logs and crash reports
- tamper and rollback considerations

## Testing and validation

- supported OS coverage
- installation, upgrade, repair, and uninstall
- accessibility and keyboard behavior
- offline and network failure
- privilege boundaries
- data migration and recovery

## Operations and release

- crash and diagnostic collection
- update rollout and rollback
- support bundles and redaction
- version and compatibility support
- local data recovery
- release and end-of-support communication

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/ui/AGENTS.md`
- `src/core/AGENTS.md`
- `src/platform/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `installer/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
