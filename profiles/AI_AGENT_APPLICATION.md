# AI Agent Application Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for applications that use language models or other AI systems to reason, retrieve content, call tools, generate outputs, or perform actions.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`ai-agent-application/`](ai-agent-application/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- tool-using AI agents
- retrieval-augmented applications
- workflow assistants
- autonomous or semi-autonomous task systems
- AI systems that generate or modify code, configuration, or operational actions

It normally does not describe:

- static machine-learning inference with no agentic tool use unless other AI controls apply
- simple search without generated decisions
- non-AI automation

## Typical starting risk

`high`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/api-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/observability/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/integration/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/documentation/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/sre/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/data-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- tool authorization and allowlists
- prompt and retrieved-content trust boundaries
- human approval for consequential actions
- identity and credential delegation
- traceable model decisions, outputs, and tool calls
- evaluation for unsafe, incorrect, or deceptive behavior
- data retention and training boundaries
- fallback, stop, and incident behavior

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- model and provider boundary
- prompt and policy layer
- retrieval and content sources
- tool broker and authorization
- memory and data stores
- human approval and audit control plane

## Security and privacy focus

- prompt injection and content trust
- tool parameter validation
- least-privilege delegated identity
- secret isolation from prompts and outputs
- data exfiltration controls
- human approval for consequential actions

## Testing and validation

- task success and failure evaluations
- prompt-injection and adversarial tests
- tool authorization and parameter tests
- hallucination and unsupported-claim checks
- privacy and data leakage tests
- fallback, stop, timeout, and provider-failure behavior

## Operations and release

- model and prompt version traceability
- tool-call audit logs
- quality and safety monitoring
- cost and rate limits
- incident shutdown and revocation
- evaluation and release ownership

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/agent/AGENTS.md`
- `src/tools/AGENTS.md`
- `src/retrieval/AGENTS.md`
- `src/policy/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `evals/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
