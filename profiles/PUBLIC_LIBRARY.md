# Public Library Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for libraries, SDKs, packages, and reusable components consumed outside the repository's direct control.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`public-library/`](public-library/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- public packages
- internal shared libraries with compatibility commitments
- SDKs
- plugins and extension libraries
- reusable modules published to registries

It normally does not describe:

- private application code with no consumer contract
- single-repository implementation details
- deployment-only configuration

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/documentation/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/api-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/accessibility/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- public API compatibility
- supported runtimes and platforms
- dependency minimization
- semantic versioning
- examples and migration guidance
- deprecation and end-of-support
- package signing and provenance
- security reporting and release process

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- public API surface
- internal implementation boundary
- dependency and extension points
- serialization and compatibility
- build and package artifacts
- consumer documentation and migration

## Security and privacy focus

- safe defaults
- input and data handling
- dependency and provenance review
- secret-free examples
- security advisory process
- unsupported-version handling

## Testing and validation

- public contract tests
- compatibility matrix
- consumer integration tests
- packaging and installation
- documentation examples
- performance and concurrency where promised

## Operations and release

- release notes and changelog
- package registry ownership
- deprecation communication
- vulnerability response
- support policy
- artifact provenance and retention

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/public/AGENTS.md`
- `src/internal/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `packaging/AGENTS.md`
- `examples/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, virtualization, operating-system, networking, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
