# Serverless Function Project Profile

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for event-driven functions whose execution, scaling, retries, identity, and lifecycle are controlled by a managed runtime.

## Complete package

Use the complete package at [`serverless-function/`](serverless-function/). This canonical file remains the stable profile entry point.

## Applicability

This profile applies to:

- HTTP-triggered functions
- queue and event consumers
- scheduled functions
- stream processors
- event-driven integration handlers

It normally does not describe:

- long-running worker services
- containerized services with explicit process lifecycle
- client-side functions

## Typical starting risk

`moderate`

This is a starting point only. The actual project or change must be classified under governance.

## Required governance

- `governance/ORGANIZATION_CONTRACT.md`
- `governance/AGENT_WORKING_METHOD.md`
- `governance/RISK_CLASSIFICATION.md`
- `governance/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`
- `governance/HUMAN_REVIEW_POLICY.md`
- `governance/PRODUCTION_READINESS.md` when deployed or operated

## Required discipline overlays

- `disciplines/application-security/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/testing/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/integration/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/observability/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/ci-cd/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/supply-chain/AGENTS.md`

## Conditionally required disciplines

- `disciplines/architecture/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/sre/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/release-engineering/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/privacy/AGENTS.md`
- `disciplines/data-engineering/AGENTS.md`

Conditional packages become required when their concern is present. Document every omission that would reasonably appear applicable.

## Required project decisions

- event validation and schema
- idempotency and duplicate delivery
- timeout, retry, and dead-letter behavior
- least-privilege execution identity
- concurrency and scaling limits
- cold-start and dependency behavior
- state and external side effects
- deployment, rollback, and observability

## Architecture and trust boundaries

- event source and delivery guarantees
- runtime and execution identity
- external dependencies
- state and idempotency store
- network and secret boundaries
- deployment and telemetry

## Security and privacy focus

- event and caller validation
- least-privilege role
- secret injection and rotation
- egress and dependency restrictions
- sensitive payload and logging boundaries
- abuse and cost controls

## Testing and validation

- event schemas and malformed events
- duplicate delivery and retries
- timeout and partial failure
- concurrency and scaling
- dependency outage
- deployment and rollback

## Operations and release

- invocation, error, retry, throttle, and dead-letter signals
- cost and concurrency monitoring
- runbooks for replay and poison events
- runtime and dependency updates
- release and rollback
- ownership of event sources and destinations

## Suggested nested instruction scopes

- `src/function/AGENTS.md`
- `src/integrations/AGENTS.md`
- `tests/AGENTS.md`
- `docs/AGENTS.md`
- `infra/AGENTS.md`

## Completion evidence

Record:

- profile selection rationale
- risk classification
- required and conditional package decisions
- architecture and trust boundaries
- project decisions
- validation commands and outcomes
- checks not run
- operational and production-readiness status
- limitations and residual risk
- accountable reviewers and approvers

## Completion gate

The project must satisfy applicable governance, language, platform, framework, discipline, and profile standards. Document exclusions, exceptions, and unvalidated behavior.

Selecting this profile does not prove the project is secure, tested, accessible, private, reliable, compatible, supportable, or production-ready.
