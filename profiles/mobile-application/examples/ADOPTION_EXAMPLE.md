# Mobile Application Project Profile Adoption Example

## Fictitious project

This example models a non-production mobile application.

No production systems, identities, credentials, endpoints, data, or approval are included.

## Profile decision

- Primary profile: [`../../MOBILE_APPLICATION.md`](../../MOBILE_APPLICATION.md)
- Typical starting risk: `moderate`
- Actual risk: must be assessed by the adopting project

## Selected disciplines

- [Application Security](../../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Architecture](../../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing](../../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Accessibility](../../../disciplines/accessibility/)
- [Privacy](../../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Supply Chain](../../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../../disciplines/release-engineering/)

## Conditional review

- [Observability](../../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Ci Cd](../../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Api Engineering](../../../disciplines/api-engineering/)
- [Integration](../../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Documentation](../../../disciplines/documentation/)

## Project decisions

- secure storage
- network trust and certificate behavior
- permission minimization
- offline and synchronization behavior
- biometric and device-authentication integration
- analytics, crash reporting, and privacy
- app-store signing and release
- minimum supported OS and upgrade path

## Suggested scopes

- src/ui
- src/domain
- src/platform
- tests
- docs
- release

## Evidence boundary

The example demonstrates composition only. It does not prove implementation, validation, review, approval, operational verification, or production readiness.
