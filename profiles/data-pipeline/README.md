# Data Pipeline Project Profile Package

## Purpose

Define the minimum standards composition for ingesting, transforming, validating, storing, and publishing data across batch, streaming, and analytical workflows.

This package is a project-shape overlay. It composes governance, language, discipline, framework, platform, and project-specific standards into a coherent starting point.

Status: **baseline**

## Canonical profile

The stable profile entry point is [`../DATA_PIPELINE.md`](../DATA_PIPELINE.md).

The canonical file provides the normative summary. This package supplies the detailed adoption model, standards, templates, and example.

## When to adopt

Adopt this profile when:

- batch ETL and ELT
- stream processing
- data ingestion
- analytics pipelines
- data export and publication workflows

Do not use it as the primary profile for:

- transactional application logic with no pipeline behavior
- ad hoc manual queries
- simple file copies with no governed data transformation

## Typical starting risk

`high`

Reclassify using actual project facts. Escalate for public exposure, privilege, destructive capability, sensitive data, tenant boundaries, weak rollback, availability, safety, or incomplete evidence.

## What this package does not replace

This package does not replace:

- governance authority and risk classification
- architecture and threat modeling
- language or framework standards
- platform ownership
- discipline packages
- organization policy or legal obligations
- project-specific tests and evidence
- production-readiness approval

## Normative entry points

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)
- [`../DATA_PIPELINE.md`](../DATA_PIPELINE.md)
- [`MANIFEST.md`](MANIFEST.md)

## Required disciplines

- [Architecture](../../disciplines/architecture/)
- [Testing](../../disciplines/testing/)
- [Integration](../../disciplines/integration/)
- [Database](../../disciplines/database/)
- [Data Engineering](../../disciplines/data-engineering/)
- [Privacy](../../disciplines/privacy/)
- [Observability](../../disciplines/observability/)
- [Sre](../../disciplines/sre/)

## Conditional disciplines

- [Application Security](../../disciplines/application-security/)
- [Ci Cd](../../disciplines/ci-cd/)
- [Supply Chain](../../disciplines/supply-chain/)
- [Release Engineering](../../disciplines/release-engineering/)
- [Documentation](../../disciplines/documentation/)

A conditional discipline becomes required when its concern exists. “Another team handles that” is a responsibility statement only when the boundary and evidence are explicit.

## Language, framework, and platform selection

This profile intentionally does not choose a language, framework, or platform.

The adopting project must declare:

- implementation languages
- frameworks
- execution and deployment platforms
- supported versions
- package and dependency management
- build and release tooling
- compatibility commitments
- operational ownership

## Required project decisions

- data contracts and ownership
- lineage and metadata
- replay and backfill behavior
- quality gates
- retention and sensitive-data handling
- schema compatibility
- late, duplicate, and out-of-order data
- recovery, cost, and operational ownership

## Architecture and trust boundaries

Document:

- sources and ingestion boundaries
- schema and contract ownership
- transformation stages
- storage layers and publication targets
- orchestration and checkpoints
- lineage, observability, and recovery

Use [`standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md`](standards/PROJECT_BOUNDARY_STANDARD.md) and [`standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md`](standards/ARCHITECTURE_DECISION_STANDARD.md).

## Security and privacy expectations

- data classification
- least-privilege access
- secret and key handling
- privacy and minimization
- safe logs and samples
- controlled export and sharing

Use [`standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md`](standards/SECURITY_PRIVACY_STANDARD.md).

## Testing and validation expectations

- data-quality rules
- schema compatibility
- replay and idempotency
- late and duplicate data
- failure and restart
- representative volume and performance

Use [`standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md`](standards/TESTING_VALIDATION_STANDARD.md).

## Operations and release expectations

- freshness, completeness, quality, and lag metrics
- backfill and replay runbooks
- retention and deletion
- capacity and cost
- dependency and schema alerts
- incident and recovery ownership

Use [`standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md`](standards/OPERATIONS_RELEASE_STANDARD.md).

## Suggested nested instructions

Consider scoped `AGENTS.md` files under:

- src/ingest
- src/transform
- src/publish
- tests
- docs
- orchestration

Nested instructions specialize local work. They may be stricter but may not silently weaken governance or the selected packages.

## Common failure modes

- undocumented lineage
- non-repeatable transformations
- backfills that double-count
- sensitive data in test samples or logs
- schema changes without consumers
- no owner for quality failures

Other recurring failures include copying example facts, treating a profile as architecture approval, omitting conditional packages without justification, and claiming completion from partial evidence.

## Adoption workflow

1. Read root governance and the [profile collection guide](../README.md).
2. Confirm this is the primary or a scoped secondary profile.
3. Record profile-selection rationale.
4. Classify risk.
5. Select language, discipline, framework, and platform packages.
6. Complete the adoption checklist.
7. Document architecture, security, tests, operations, and release decisions.
8. Add nested instructions for distinct scopes.
9. Define exact validation commands and evidence.
10. Review exclusions and exceptions.
11. Validate links, IDs, manifests, and project behavior.
12. Obtain accountable review.

## Tailoring checklist

Before adoption, define:

- project purpose and non-goals
- users and operators
- interfaces and trust boundaries
- data and privacy
- identities and privileges
- state and storage
- dependencies and integrations
- deployment and environments
- supported versions
- validation and test environments
- observability and support
- recovery and migration
- release and compatibility
- evidence retention
- reviewers and approvers

## Evidence

Use [`templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md) and [`standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md`](standards/COMPLETION_EVIDENCE.md).

Evidence should include:

- profile rationale
- selected and omitted packages
- risk
- changed scope
- decisions
- validation commands and results
- representative environments
- checks not run
- limitations and residual risk
- review and approval
- production-readiness status

## Common validation

From the standards repository root:

```bash
python tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py
python tools/check-links/check_links.py
```

The adopting project must define executable checks for its real implementation.

## Templates and example

- [`ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/ADOPTION_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`](templates/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md)
- [`EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/EVIDENCE_RECORD_TEMPLATE.md)
- [`ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md`](examples/ADOPTION_EXAMPLE.md)

Examples are fictitious. Replace them with reviewed facts and actual evidence.

## Maintenance

Package changes must preserve stable IDs, update canonical and package files together, state migration impact, validate links, and disclose checks not run.

## Completion boundary

Adopting this package does not prove that the project is complete or production-ready. Completion requires implementation, validation, evidence, and accountable review.
