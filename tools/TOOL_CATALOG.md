## Stable entry points

Stable Python entry paths include:

- `tools/validate-standards/validate_repository.py`
- `tools/check-links/check_links.py`
- `tools/validate-skills/validate_skills.py`
- `tools/validate-schemas/validate_schemas.py`
- `tools/validate-templates/validate_templates.py`
- `tools/validate-tools/validate_tools.py`
- `tools/release/validate_release.py`
- `tools/release/build_release.py`
- `tools/generate-manifest/generate_manifest.py`
- `tools/compose-agents/compose_agents.py`
- `tools/validate-all/run_all.py`

Moving or renaming a stable entry point requires migration guidance and the release classification defined by `RELEASE_POLICY.md`.

## Selection

Use a specific validator during focused development. Use `validate-all` before review or merge.

Use `validate-release` when changing VERSION, changelog, maturity, deprecation, migration, release notes, tags, release tooling, or release workflows.

Use `build-release` only after the versioned release files have been reviewed and validation passes.

Use `generate-manifest` when beginning a project composition. Use `compose-agents` only after the generated manifest is reviewed and accepted as a correct selection record.

## Ownership

Every tool change must identify:

- implementation owner
- contract owner
- CI owner
- affected consumers
- documentation owner
- migration owner for breaking changes
- release owner when the change affects packaging, tags, checksums, or publication

Release-tool and release-workflow changes require the specialist review defined in `MAINTAINERS.md`.

## Evidence

A tool execution record should capture:

- tool path and version
- repository revision
- exact command
- environment
- exit code
- JSON result where practical
- checks not run
- limitations

A release-tool execution should additionally capture:

- repository VERSION
- tag
- source commit
- artifact names and sizes
- SHA-256 digests
- release manifest
- checksum verification result
- GitHub Release URL after publication
