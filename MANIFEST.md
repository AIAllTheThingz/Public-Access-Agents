## Complete repository toolchain

- repository structure validation

The stable validator entry paths remain present. Shared executable tools support text and JSON results, common exit-code semantics, and offline operation. Writing tools preserve safe overwrite behavior. Release artifacts are checksum-backed and tied to the source commit.

## Validation

```bash
python -m pip install -r tools/validate-schemas/requirements.txt
python tools/validate-all/run_all.py --include-tests
python tools/release/validate_release.py
```
